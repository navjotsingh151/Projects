## What are recommendation engines?
Till recently, people generally tended to buy products recommended to them by their friends or the people they trust. This used to be the primary method of purchase when there was any doubt about the product. But with the advent of the digital age, that circle has expanded to include online sites that utilize some sort of recommendation engine.

**A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.**

## How does a recommendation engine work?
Before we deep dive into this topic, first weâ€™ll think of how we can recommend items to users:

1. We can recommend items to a user which are most popular among all the users
2. We can divide the users into multiple segments based on their preferences (user features) and recommend items to them based on the segment they belong to

## Content based filtering
This algorithm recommends products which are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past.
